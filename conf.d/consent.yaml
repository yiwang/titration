    STUDY OVERVIEW <br/><br/>

    The purpose of this study is to investigate how people make decisions. The survey will consist of a series of decision making questions. 
    The survey will take about 30-40 minutes to complete.  <br/><br/>

    RISKS  <br/><br/>
     
    There are no foreseeable risks or discomforts to you in filling out the questionnaire or completing the tasks. All safeguards will be taken to maintain the confidentiality of your decisions, as described in the "Confidentiality" section below.  <br/><br/>
     
    BENEFITS  <br/><br/>
     
    There are no direct benefits that will come to you for participating in this survey. However, there are indirect benefits arising from the potential of the survey to provide valuable information about the psychological processes underlying many important yet everyday decision-making behaviors. Your participation in this survey will, therefore, be of scientific value by contributing to our understanding of the causes of people's preferences and choices. <br/><br/>
     
     
    COMPENSATION  <br/><br/>
     
    Participants who complete the study will receive $8 for their participation in this research.<br/><br/>

     
    CONFIDENTIALITY  <br/><br/>
     
    To ensure confidentiality, data will be analyzed and stored with code numbers, never any information that could be used to identify participants. Data will be kept on secure servers and password-protected computers. The data will be stored indefinitely after the termination of the current research for a period no shorter than 6 years, and at no time will any identifying information about the participants be stored along with the data.  <br/><br/>
     
     
     
    VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION  <br/><br/>
     
    Participation in this study is completely voluntary and non-coercive with no negative consequences for refusal to participate.
