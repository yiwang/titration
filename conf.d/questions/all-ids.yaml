    Imagine that you live in a region that has a fairly constant climate all year round, like San Diego. The current air quality (measured by number and size of particulates) in the area is moderate and the local county government is considering a temporary change to its emissions policy to study the effects of air quality on human health and the local wildlife. The particulate output of nearby factories will be reduced, but the factories will be compensated so that they do not incur any costs during the test period. The test will lead to an immediate improvement in air quality over a period of three weeks ($BASE_VALUE days), after which time the air quality will return to its former level. However, the government is also considering carrying out the test a year from now, for a different length of time. Which one would you prefer, improved air quality immediately for 21 days, or improved air quality a year from now for a longer duration?<br/><br/>

    No matter when the test period begins, the government will start implementing the new policy two years from today's date, if the new policy is approved.

    请设想一下, 您住在一个气候比较稳定的地方, 比如昆明. 您那里的空气质量 (主要是空气中的浮尘) 属于中等. 当地政府准备试行一段时间一个新的排污政策, 用来测试空气质量对人们的身体健康以及对当地野生动物的影响. 试行期间,附近的工厂要减少大气排放. 因为减少排放而造成工厂的利润损失将由政府补贴. 如果现在马上开始试行的话, 试行会持续3个星期 ($BASE_VALUE 天).<br/><br/>

    这3个星期的空气质量会有所提高. 3个星期以后将恢复原有政策, 空气质量回落到现有水平. 当地政府也在考虑等到一年以后再做这个试行测试. 如果等到一年以后再试行, 试行持续的时间长短还没有确定. 您是愿意试行马上开始, 接下来$BASE_VALUE天的空气质量都有提高, 还是愿意等一年再试行, 试行时间更长(空气质量比较好的时间更长)?<br/><br/>

    无论试行何时开始, 如果该排污政策被批准，政府都会在两年之后正式执行该政策.

    Imagine that you live a city that has a population of 250,000. The current unemployment rate in the city is 15%, which is about twice the national unemployment rate of 9%.  Unemployment has caused a series of serious problems in the city, including a rising crime rate.<br/><br/>

    There is a lake in your city. You do not drink the lake water or swim in the lake, but you enjoy the view and sometimes picnic by the lake.<br/><br/>
    
    The lake has a good self-cleaning capacity. In any given year, the probability that the lake becomes so polluted that it is beyond self-cleaning, is $BASE_VALUE%. If that happens, the population of fish and birds in the lake will be greatly reduced and there will be a bad smell all over the area, including where you live. If the lake becomes polluted for 3 months without successful self-cleaning, the city council pays for the cleaning.<br/><br/>

    The local government is considering giving permission to several companies to set up a series of large factories close to a lake in order to stimulate the economy and help solve the unemployment problem. It has been estimated that those new factories and their subsequent influence on the economy will decrease the unemployment rate from 15% to 10%. But they will also increase the probability of the lake being polluted in any given year. Would you vote to give permission for the setting up of these factories if the probability of pollution increases?

    请设想一下, 您所居住的城市有25万人口. 现在这个城市的失业率是15%, 而全国的平均失业率是9%. 失业率过高造成很多严重的问题, 包括犯罪率上升.<br/><br/>

    当地有一个湖. 您不饮用湖里的水, 也不去湖里游泳. 但是您喜欢湖上风景, 有的时候会跟家人和朋友去湖边野餐.<br/><br/>
    
    这个湖有比较强的自我清洁能力. 一般来说, 一年中这个湖被污染得太严重以至于自我清洁不再有效的可能性只有3%. 如果这种情况发生的话, 鱼虾和水鸟数量都会减少, 附近区域, 包括您住的地方, 都有弥漫异味. 要是这种状态持续3个月以上, 湖水还是不能自我清洁, 政府就会出钱人工清洁湖水.<br/><br/>

    为了刺激经济和解决失业率问题, 当地政府准备允许几家公司在湖边修工厂. 据估计, 这些新工厂将刺激经济, 将失业率从15%降低到10%.  这样做的后果是, 每年湖水被污染的可能性会增大.
    如果这种被污染的可能性从$BASE_VALUE%上升到$VAR_VALUE%, 您会支持在湖边建工厂吗?
