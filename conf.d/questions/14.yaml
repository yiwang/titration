    Imagine that you live a city that has a population of 250,000. The current unemployment rate in the city is 15%, which is about twice the national unemployment rate of 9%.  Unemployment has caused a series of serious problems in the city, including a rising crime rate.<br/><br/>

    There is a lake in your city. You do not drink the lake water or swim in the lake, but you enjoy the view and sometimes picnic by the lake.<br/><br/>
    
    The lake has a good self-cleaning capacity. In any given year, the probability that the lake becomes so polluted that it is beyond self-cleaning, is $BASE_VALUE%. If that happens, the population of fish and birds in the lake will be greatly reduced and there will be a bad smell all over the area, including where you live. If the lake becomes polluted for 3 months without successful self-cleaning, the city council pays for the cleaning.<br/><br/>

    The local government is considering giving permission to several companies to set up a series of large factories close to a lake in order to stimulate the economy and help solve the unemployment problem. It has been estimated that those new factories and their subsequent influence on the economy will decrease the unemployment rate from 15% to 10%. But they will also increase the probability of the lake being polluted in any given year. Would you vote to give permission for the setting up of these factories if the probability of pollution increases?

    请设想一下, 您所居住的城市有25万人口. 现在这个城市的失业率是15%, 而全国的平均失业率是9%. 失业率过高造成很多严重的问题, 包括犯罪率上升.<br/><br/>

    当地有一个湖. 您不饮用湖里的水, 也不去湖里游泳. 但是您喜欢湖上风景, 有的时候会跟家人和朋友去湖边野餐.<br/><br/>
    
    这个湖有比较强的自我清洁能力. 一般来说, 一年中这个湖被污染得太严重以至于自我清洁不再有效的可能性只有3%. 如果这种情况发生的话, 鱼虾和水鸟数量都会减少, 附近区域, 包括您住的地方, 都有弥漫异味. 要是这种状态持续3个月以上, 湖水还是不能自我清洁, 政府就会出钱人工清洁湖水.<br/><br/>

    为了刺激经济和解决失业率问题, 当地政府准备允许几家公司在湖边修工厂. 据估计, 这些新工厂将刺激经济, 将失业率从15%降低到10%.  这样做的后果是, 每年湖水被污染的可能性会增大.
    如果这种被污染的可能性从$BASE_VALUE%上升到$VAR_VALUE%, 您会支持在湖边建工厂吗?
