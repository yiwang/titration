   The next questions involve decisions about health. Please imagine that you are in full health. Here is a description of full health:<br/>
   
   You do not need to take any medication. You are also free to eat almost any foods you like. You never have trouble falling asleep. You are always able to concentrate on important tasks.<br/><br/>
   
   In the following questions, you will have to choose between two disorders that will cause you to lose your full health. Losing your full health means your health will fit the following description of poor health:<br/>

   Because of your doctor's instructions, you need to take medication (pills) once a day. You must also be very careful about what foods you eat, so you spend a lot of time keeping track of what you eat. You sometimes have trouble falling asleep. It is difficult to concentrate.<br/><br/>

   Each disorder only lasts for a limited period of time. After the disorder is over, most patients find that they return to their full health state within a few days. Thus, each of the two disorders would cause you to be in poor health for a limited period of time; after that you will return to your current full health. The disorders differ in the amount of time you will spend in poor health. You will experience only one of the two disorders, but you must experience one.
