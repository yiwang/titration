    Imagine that you were born with a congenital heart defect that has a 20% chance of causing permanent decreased heart function and rhythm disturbances forcing you to significantly limit your activity and especially avoid participating in outdoor activities and sports. There is a new medicine that if taken continually, can reduce the risk of permanent damage and rhythm disturbances from 20% to 5%. Your insurance company does not cover the expense of the medicine. Would you be willing to pay for the medicine by yourself if it costs $VAR_VALUE% of your salary every month?
