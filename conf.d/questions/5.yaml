    Imagine you just won a lottery, worth $250, which will be paid to you immediately. However, the lottery commission is giving you the option of receiving a different amount, paid to you a year from now. Which one would you prefer, $$BASE_VALUE immediately, or a bigger sum, a year from now?
  zh:>
    请设想一下, 您刚刚中了个250元的奖. 您可以马上去兑现, 或者一年以后再兑现更大的奖. 请问您愿意选择哪一个奖?
