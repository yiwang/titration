    Imagine that you live in a region that has a fairly constant climate all year around, like San Diego. The current air quality (measured by number and size of particulates) in the area is moderate and the local county government is considering a temporary change to its emissions policy to study the effects of air quality on human health and the local wildlife. The pollution output of nearby factories and power plants will be increased, but they will be taxed so that they do not incur any extra profits during the test period. The test will lead to an immediate decrease in air quality over a period of three weeks ($BASE_VALUE days), after which time the air quality will return to its former level. However, the government is also considering carrying out the test a year from now, for a different length of time.Which one would you prefer, deterioration in air quality immediately for $BASE_VALUE days, or deterioration in air quality a year from now for a longer period?

    请设想一下, 您住在一个气候比较稳定的地方, 比如昆明. 您那里的空气质量 (主要是空气中的浮尘) 属于中等. 当地政府准备试行一段时间一个新的排污政策, 用来测试空气质量对人们的身体健康以及对当地野生动物的影响. 试行期间,附近的工厂会增加大气排放. 因为增加排放, 工厂要交额外的税, 所以增加排放不会给工厂带来额外的利润. 如果现在马上开始试行这个新政策的话, 试行会持续3个星期($BASE_VALUE 天). 这3个星期的空气质量会有所下降. 3个星期以后将恢复原有政策, 空气质量回升到现有水平. 当地政府也在考虑等到一年以后再做这个试行测试. 如果等到一年以后再试行, 试行持续的时间长短还没有确定. 您是愿意试行马上开始, 接下来$BASE_VALUE天的空气质量都有下降, 还是愿意等一年再试行, 试行时间更长   (比较好空气质量比较差的时间更长)?

    - Deterioration in air quality immediately for $BASE_VALUE days.
    - Deterioration in air quality a year from now for $VAR_VALUE days.

    - 试行马上开始, 接下来$BASE_VALUE天的空气质量都有下降.
    - 等一年再试行, 试行时间持续$VAR_VALUE天 ($VAR_VALUE天比较差的空气质量).
note:
  en: Note that we are not interested in how you feel about the government’s decision on changing its policy. What we are interested in is your preference between the two options. 
  zh: 请注意, 我们是想知道您觉得以上两个可能性中的哪一个比较好, 而不是您对以上政策的看法.
