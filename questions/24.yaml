    Every spring you suffer from sneezing, coughing, and a runny nose. Your symptoms are manageable, but annoying. They can become much worse if you overexpose yourself to certain irritants like pollen and mold.<br/><br/>
 
    There is a central air system in your current apartment building that filters out most of the pollen and mold from your home air. With the air system turned on between March and May, in any given spring, you have a 5% chance of aggravating your allergies by pollen and mold particles that stay in your home. This year, however, the air system in your building is broken. The lease office gives you two options:<br/><br/>
    
    staying, or moving to another building. If you decide to move to another building with a functioning air system, the lease office will cover all of your moving costs. The new apartment will be identical to your current one, and the filter system works. If you decide to stay in your current home, the lease office will give you rent credit. According to your doctor, your chance of getting an aggravated allergy will be increased from 5% to 20% without the air system.Which one would you prefer, move to another building with the air system, or accept rent credit worth $VAR_VALUE% of your monthly rent and stay in the current building without the air system?
