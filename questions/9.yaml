    Research has shown that people who have a gym membership are more likely to exercise regularly and have a smaller chance of catching a variety of diseases.
    Imagine that you recently signed a 2-year-lease for an apartment. As a token of appreciation, the lease office offers a free gym membership for $BASE_VALUE weeks. Because of the large number of new tenants this week, the office proposes that anyone who is willing to defer their gym membership by one year will receive a longer period of free gym membership than $BASE_VALUE weeks. Which membership package would you prefer?

    有研究显示,跟一般人比较, 健身房的会员定期运动的可能性大一些, 得病的几率小一些.  请设想一下, 您最近签了一个2年的租房合同. 这个合同里面包括了12周的免费健身房会员费. 这个星期, 房产公司发现因为新签合同的人很多, 健身房可能会太拥挤. 于是, 房产公司提出租房的人如果愿意等明年这个时候再享受他们的免费健身房, 他们可以得到更多的免费时间. 请问您是愿意现在享受$BASE_VALUE周的免费健身房, 还是一年以后享受比$BASE_VALUE周时间更长的免费健身房?
ans:
  en:
    - Getting $BASE_VALUE free weeks immediately
    - Getting $VAR_VALUE free weeks a year from now
  zh:
    - 现在享受$BASE_VALUE周的免费健身房.
    - 明年这个时候再享受$VAR_VALUE周的免费健身房.

  en: Note that we are not interested in how you feel about exercise. What we are interested in is your preference between the two options.
  zh: 请注意, 我们是想知道您觉得以上两个可能性中的哪一个比较好, 而不是您对健身的看法.
