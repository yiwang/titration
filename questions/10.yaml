     Imagine that your company is sending you to one of its divisions overseas in a highly industrialized area for a certain period of time. Because of the high level of bacteria in the water, the chance of contracting a waterborne or foodborne disease from contaminated water is considerably high. You have no choice but to go overseas because you need this job to support your family. You have the choice of going overseas immediately for $BASE_VALUE weeks, or you can defer the task for a year and leave exactly one year from today and stay there for a longer term. Which one would you prefer?

    请设想一下, 您所在的公司准备把您派到一个工业污染比较严重的地方去工作一段时间. 由于当地生活用水中的微生物污染, 您有比较高的可能性会得病. 您需要这份工作养家糊口, 所以您别无选择, 不得不听从安排. 不过您有机会选择去工作的时间. 如果您马上就去的话, 您需要在那里工作$BASE_VALUE周. 您也可以推迟到明年这个时候再去. 如果您决定明年再去的话, 您需要在那里工作更长时间.  请问您会选择马上去，还是明年去?
