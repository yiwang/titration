    Imagine that a real estate company recently built new apartment building in two distinct areas. The units and other conditions in those two areas are similar except for the fact that area A has better air quality than area B. In the past 5 years, the local air quality inspection agency rated the air quality in area A as Excellent 20 out of 20 times, and rated the air quality in area B as Excellent once, Good 5 times, and Average 14 times out of 20 times.<br/><br/>
    
    For the purpose of marketing strategy, the company does not allow their clients to choose the area. Instead, the company randomly assigns the tenants to the two areas. That is, when you a rent an apartment from them, you have 50% chance of getting an unit in area A, and 50% chance of getting one in area B.<br/><br/>
    
    Imagine that you have recently signed the contract to rent an apartment. Your agent tells you that you can also pay extra money to increase your chance of getting an apartment in area A. Would you be willing to pay the amount of 30% of your monthly rent to increase your chance of renting an apartment in area A?

    请设想一下,有一家房产公司在两个区域修了很多新楼房. 这两个地方条件类似. 唯一的差别是甲区的空气质量比乙区的好. 在过去5年中, 空气检测机构检测了20次空气质量, 甲区20次都是非常好. 乙区有1次非常好, 5次好, 14次一般. <br/><br/>
    
    作为一种市场销售策略, 这个房产公司不让它的客户挑选所在区域. 租房者得到甲区或者乙区房子的可能性各是$BASE_VALUE%. <br/><br/>

    您刚刚签下合同要租一套房子. 这个时候, 您的代理告诉您, 如果您愿意付额外的钱, 您可以提高您得到甲区房子的几率. 请问您是否愿意付相当于30%的月租的钱提高您赢得甲区的几率?
