    Imagine that you and your friend are playing chess. The winner will toss a die. If it is 6, the loser has to pay $$VAR_VALUE to the winner. That is, the loser has 1/6 chance of paying the winner $$VAR_VALUE.<br/><br/>
    
    Unfortunately, you are the loser in the game, which means that you have 1/6 chance of losing $$VAR_VALUE. The winner offers you a chance to buy her out. She will not toss the die if you agree to pay her $$BASE_VALUE.<br/><br/>
 
    You have $600 on you. You won the money from a lottery a couple days ago. Which one would you prefer, paying her $$BASE_VALUE, or taking the 1/6 chance of paying her more money?

    请设想一下, 您和您的朋友在下棋. 赢了的人会掷一次骰子. 如果朝上的一面是6, 输了的一方要付给赢方$VAR_VALUE元. 也就是说, 输了的人有1/6的可能性要给赢方付$VAR_VALUE元.<br/><br/>
    
    很不幸, 您输棋了. 您现在有1/6的可能性要付给赢方$VAR_VALUE元. 赢方给了您另外一个解决办法. 如果您肯现在付给她$BASE_VALUE元, 她就不掷这个骰子了.<br/><br/>
 
    您身上有600元. 是前两天您买彩票中的奖. 请问您愿意付给赢方$BASE_VALUE元还是愿意选择1/6的可能性付给她更多钱?
